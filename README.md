# CSI-280-Project

A Volunteering Website created for the purpose of being an open source project at Champlain College for CSI-280

Main Contributors: Luke Cutter, Justin Allman, Alex Cattani, Mike Kerwood, and Landis Humphrey

A website that takes local charities and connects them to users on a seamless website.
The website will allow users to pick the dates they want to volunteer and the times and communicates that to the charities.
Essentially a website that makes it easy to volunteer on your time while filling the slots that are needed by the charities around town.
It will use responsive web design and a calendar-view to make the site easy to use. There will be individual pages for charities so the user has choice of opportunity.
I have a whole pitch deck at the ready which fleshes this idea out more: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18UCRgql1qualeKRtdtrEo7NewHF9d0E0cJDt_lxfGY8/edit?usp=sharing
